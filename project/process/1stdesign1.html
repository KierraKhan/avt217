	<p>I really like this design for the overall website. I added the circle picture of me because Stephanie liked it, and I like it too! Majority also loved putting the social media links to the footer so I did that for both of my mockups. I also got rid of the about me and contact me sections from the homepage because it was a repeat from the about page.</p>

	<div id="portfolio page">
	<h3>Portfolio Page</h3>
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_portfolio1.jpg" alt="Portfolio page with Grids">
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_portfolio1(no_grid).jpg" alt="Portfolio page">
	<p>I kept the organized layout from wireframe 1. I couldn't decide if I wanted to put frames around all the works or just leave the work how it is. I also wanted to put a light green square when your mouse is over the work. Plus, I kept the light brown color on the portfolio header to indicate that you're on that page.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="about/contact page">
	<h3>About Page</h3>
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_about1.jpg" alt="About page with Grids">
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_about1(no_grid).jpg" alt="About page">
	<p>I really like the layout here combining the about me and contact me sections. I am still debating on adding my signature here in the box, so I don't know if I should or not. And I am going to add in my paragraph later on.</p>

	<h3>Individual Works Page</h3>
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_individ1.jpg" alt="Individual work with Grids">
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_individ1(no_grid).jpg" alt="Individual work">
	<p>I kept the layout from wireframe 1. I also added the arrows to go to the previous or next artwork. Again I am going to put in the artwork paragraph later.</p>
