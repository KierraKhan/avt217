	<h2>Initial Mockup 2</h2>
	<div id="home page">
	<h3>Home Page</h3>
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_home2.jpg" alt="Home page with Grids">
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_home2(no_grid).jpg" alt="Home page">
	<p>I changed the layout of the home page because again I just got rid of the about me and contact me sections. I moved around my best works and added boxes around the title and welcome paragraph. I also changed the header because I don't see the point of having a contact lick when its gonna take you directly to the about me page anyways. So I kept the logo, portfolio category, and about catagory. I also changed the footer color as well. Meaning that the header and footer here are gonne be the same for the rest of the pages.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div id="portfolio page">
	<h3>Portfolio Page</h3>
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_portfolio2.jpg" alt="Portfolio page with Grids">
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_portfolio2(no_grid).jpg" alt="Portfolio page">
	<p>I added the box around the different types of work to keep it organized. I also made the pictures of my works a bit smaller. When your mouse is on one of the works its gonna highlight it a light green, just like the other mockup. And the portfolio header changes to a light brown to show that you are on the portfolio page. I'm still a bit iffy on how the work is organized, it kinda looks cramped up still.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div id="about/contact page">
	<h3>About Page</h3>
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_about2.jpg" alt="About page with Grids">
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_about2(no_grid).jpg" alt="About page">
	<p>I kept the same type of layout from the first mockup because I really like this organization. Added the boxes again and changed the color to a light green. I also got rid of the signature box because I didn't really have room for it. And the About header is also changed to a light brown to show that you're on the current page.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div id="individual work page">
	<h3>Individual Works Page</h3>
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_individ2.jpg" alt="Individual work with Grids">
	<img src="images/Initial drafts/portfolio_individ2(no_grid).jpg" alt="Individual work">
	<p>Same layout format from the first mockup. Just changed the date text color to light green. And added light green boxes around the artwork and information of that artpiece.</p>
