	<h1>Design Brief for Kierra Khan's Portfolio Website</h1>
	<br>
	<h2><u>Brief</u></h2>
	<p>After looking at many different portfolio websites, they are all unique in the artists style and how they choose to display their works. They all display their best works and provide a well organized navigation in their websites. In order to build a reputation artists and designers must display their portfolio in an easy clickable way.</p>
	<br>
	<h2><u>Objective</u></h2>
	<p>Because I am a beginner at Graphic Design, I want to use this website as a progressional overlook on my works. Seeing how well I learned a grow by showcasing updated works. I am mostly going to use this website for applying to jobs, so I need to display my best works without clicking too much in the website.</p>
