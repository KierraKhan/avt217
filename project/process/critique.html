	<br>
	<p>I really love her style and color scheme she picked out. Really unique compared to the other portfolios in this critique. When looking at June's work, it is catagorized by its topic and the colors she use is consistant. The navigation is also easy to follow as well.June definetly has a unique personality and the website reflects that.</p>

	<p>This portfolio gives a really clean feeling. The fonts and descriptions are dainty and the website itself has a lot of negative space. It is very organized and when you hover your mouse on her works, it names the topic of the work, a like icon shows so you can like the work, and a share icon to share.</p>

	<br>
	<p>This portfolio has a lot of negative space which is really handy because it makes his photography really stand out. I also like how Anthony chose a font that isn't too distracting. I also love how his work is organized in the navigation feature.</p>

	<br>
	<p>Another clean photography portfolio. I really love how this photographer chose really bold fonts for most of his website. Again the photos really pop out of the white, negative space and easy navigation. And the website opens with his own edited video that automatically plays.</p>

		<br>
		<p>I really love this graphic design artist, Malika Favre. Her work is really organized and neat. You can really see the grid format she went with. Reminds me of instagram in a way. This is my top favorite portfolio. And the navigation is easy to navigate as well.</p>
